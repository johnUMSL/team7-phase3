# Class: CS 4500, Phase 3 Program Name: team7-phase3, Date: 10/03/2024, Last Modified: 10/18/2024
# Programmed using Python 3.10.4, the development environment is Visual Studio Code.
# Programmed by John Garrett, Connor Gilmore, and Matthew Dobbs.

#Who Did What:
#Connor Gilmore: Report 5 and central data structure
#Aaron Graham: Report 1 and Graph A
#Matthew Dobbs: Graph C
#Alewiya Duressa: Report 2
#Logan Bessinger: Report 4
#John Garrett: Report 3 and Graph B and Validation


# Description of program:
# This program processes time logs for a team. It starts by checking if the correct number
# of time log files are present (between 2 and 10). It stops and shows an error if there are too few, too many, 
# or if any files have duplicate names. It then verifies that each file is valid and that the names inside of
# each file are unique. Next, it ensures all logs share the same Class ID, halting with an error if there are
# differnces. If there the correct number of files, and all are valid, the program collects data from the
# time logs to generate and display reports and graphs. These reports are saved as text files. 
# Graphs are shown one at a time, pausing for user input before moving on. The program then ends with a
# goodbye message.

# Build instructions: 
# To compile and build an executable file for this program, make sure you have pyinstaller in your virtual environment.
# Once your virtual environment has been activated, you can install pyinstaller by typing in the terminal "pip install pyinstaller" (Do not include "")
# Once installed, then type in the terminal "pyinstaller --onefile main.py" (Do not include "")
# The file will build and an executable file named "main.exe" and save it in the dist folder within your project.
# main.exe can be moved and run from any location, but the CSV files you are reading MUST be in the same location.
# In your terminal, navigate to the location of main.exe, confirm the existense of your CSV files, 
# and run the executable using the command "./main.exe".

#central data structure:  dict[str, list[LogEntry]]
#dictionary where the unique is a the name of student from a csv file
#and the dictionary value is a list of log entry objects from that csv file 
#where each log entry represents a log csv row
